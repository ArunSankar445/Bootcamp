# K-Means Clustering Implementation
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating basic K-Means clustering concepts, including implementation, centroid selection, and result variability.
## Task 1: Basic K-Means Implementation
Uses a simple 2D dataset.

Implements K-Means clustering with a predefined number of clusters.

Visualizes the grouped data points and centroids.

## Task 2: Centroid Selection
Uses the same dataset from Task 1.

Runs K-Means with different initial centroid positions.

Visualizes multiple clustering outcomes due to centroid initialization variability.

Discusses how random initialization affects results.
