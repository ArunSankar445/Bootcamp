## Day 2: Applications of Data Science & AI vs ML vs DL 

### Task 1: Real-World Applications of Data Science
A detailed Word document (Data_Science_Applications.docx) explaining various real-world applications of Data Science in fields such as Healthcare, Finance, Retail, and more.

### Task 2: AI, ML, and DL Relationship
A visual diagram (AI_vs_ML_vs_DL_Diagram.png) illustrating the hierarchical relationship between Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) with a short explanation.

## Day 3: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

### Task 1 & 2: Dog Class
Implemented a Dog class with attributes (name, age) and methods (bark(), sleep()).
Added a constructor (__init__) to initialize the attributes.

### Task 3: Puppy Class (Inheritance)
Created a Puppy class that inherits from Dog and includes an additional method (play).

### Task 4: Hybrid Class (Multiple Inheritance)
Implemented a Hybrid class that inherits from both Dog and Cat classes, demonstrating multiple inheritance in Python.

## Day 4: Regression - Simple Linear Regression Model

### Task 1: Implement Simple Linear Regression
Used Python (Scikit-learn) to create a Simple Linear Regression model with one predictor variable.

### Task 2: Data Visualization
Plotted the dataset and the regression line using matplotlib and seaborn.
Regression_Plot.png contains the visualization of the regression model.
