# OOP in Python: Animal Classes
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python. The examples focus on defining and using classes for different animals.
## Task 1 & 2: Dog Class
Implemented a Dog class with attributes (name, age) and methods (bark(), sleep()).

Added a constructor (__init__) to initialize the attributes.
## Task 3: Puppy Class (Inheritance)
Created a Puppy class that inherits from Dog and includes an additional method (play).
## Task 4: Hybrid Class (Multiple Inheritance)
Implemented a Hybrid class that inherits from both Dog and Cat classes, demonstrating multiple inheritance in Python.
