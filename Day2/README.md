# AI & Data Science Applications
This repository contains two tasks related to AI, Machine Learning, and Data Science applications.

## Task 1: AI & Data Science in Various Fields
### The first document explores how AI and Data Science are applied in different domains:

Traffic Management & Optimization: AI analyzes GPS data to predict congestion, optimize traffic signals, and suggest better routes.

Spam Email Detection: Machine learning helps filter spam, detect phishing attempts, and improve accuracy over time.

Journalism & Fake News Detection: AI verifies sources, detects biased content, and identifies deepfakes.

Smart Cities & Urban Planning: Data science enhances energy management, pollution control, and disaster response using smart sensors.

Mental Health & Well-being: AI chatbots detect distress, wearable devices track stress and sleep, and social media analysis helps identify signs of depression.

## Task 2: Relationship Between AI, ML, and DL
### The second document explains the relationship between Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL):

AI (Artificial Intelligence): The broad concept of machines simulating human intelligence.

ML (Machine Learning): A subset of AI that enables machines to learn from data without explicit programming.

DL (Deep Learning): A subset of ML that uses neural networks to handle complex tasks like image recognition and speech processing.
