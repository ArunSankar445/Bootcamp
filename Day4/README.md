# Machine Learning with Python
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating fundamental machine learning concepts using Python.
## Task (1): Implement Simple Linear Regression
Uses numpy and pandas for data manipulation.

Implements data visualization with matplotlib.

Splits data into training and testing sets using train_test_split.

Trains a linear regression model using scikit-learn.
## Task (2): Data Visualization
Similar to Task (1) but may include variations in dataset usage or model evaluation techniques.

Demonstrates additional machine learning techniques.
